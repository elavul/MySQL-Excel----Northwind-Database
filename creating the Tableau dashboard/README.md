Mini insights:

Now, this chart is interactive — meaning when we click on one visualization, it dynamically updates the others in real time.

Let’s take the **Beverages** category as an example and explore how it performs across different months of the year. We immediately notice something interesting: in **February**, there’s a sharp drop in sales — nearly **97%** — which could indicate a significant performance issue. This anomaly is worth investigating further.

Next, let’s switch to a **map visualization** to see how this category performs across different countries, like the **USA** and **Canada**. Something interesting stands out here — **Canada** appears to be selling more **premium products**.

This chart helps us analyze whether higher-priced items are actually driving more revenue. A combination of **low prices** and **high product counts** might indicate inefficiency or low profitability.

For instance:
- **Meat/Poultry** has the **highest average price**, but **Beverages** leads in overall **revenue** — suggesting that **sales volume** is just as important as price.
- **Produce** shows a **high average price** but **low revenue**, possibly due to fewer products or lower demand.

We also see that categories like **Seafood**, **Condiments**, and **Confections** have **high inventory levels** but **low profitability**. They offer a wide range of products, yet generate less revenue, with **unit prices** often **5–8% below the average**.
