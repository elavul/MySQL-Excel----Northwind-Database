#### Mini insights:

Now, this chart is interactive — meaning when we click on one visualization, it dynamically updates the others in real time.

Let’s take the **Beverages** category as an example and explore how it performs across different months of the year. We immediately notice something interesting: in **February**, there’s a sharp drop in sales — nearly **97%** — which could indicate a significant performance issue. This anomaly is worth investigating further.

Next, let’s switch to a **map visualization** to see how this category performs across different countries, like the **USA** and **Canada**. Something interesting stands out here — **Canada** appears to be selling more **premium products**.

This chart helps us analyze whether higher-priced items are actually driving more revenue. A combination of **low prices** and **high product counts** might indicate inefficiency or low profitability.

For instance:
- **Meat/Poultry** has the **highest average price**, but **Beverages** leads in overall **revenue** — suggesting that **sales volume** is just as important as price.
- **Produce** shows a **high average price** but **low revenue**, possibly due to fewer products or lower demand.

We also see that categories like **Seafood**, **Condiments**, and **Confections** have **high inventory levels** but **low profitability**. They offer a wide range of products, yet generate less revenue, with **unit prices** often **5–8% below the average**.


#### More in-depth insights:
##### Beverages
* Top Performer: Highest revenue (~£99,699)
* High Avg. Price: £38 (above category avg of £28.92)
* High Sales Volume: 2,289 units sold
* Insight: Strong mix of volume and pricing — likely a well-balanced product line appealing to both mass market and premium buyers.
* Opportunity: Consider expanding the product line or bundling for upsells.

##### Meat/Poultry
* Low Units Sold: 1,288
* High Avg. Price: £54 (the highest!)
* Strong Revenue: £51,636
* Insight: This category is a high-margin, low-volume star — small increases in units sold could massively boost revenue.
* Opportunity: Targeted promotions or niche partnerships to increase demand could pay off quickly.

##### Confections & Condiments
* Mid to Low Revenue: ~£35k–54k
* Lower Avg. Price: £23–25
* Decent Volume
* Insight: These categories sell okay, but their low unit prices limit profit.
* Recommendation: Review pricing strategy. Could you premiumize the offering (e.g., artisan options)?

##### Grains/Cereals
* Bottom Performer on all fronts:
* Revenue: £22,370
* Avg. Price: £20 (lowest)
* Units Sold: 912
* Insight: Inefficient — low demand, low price, low return.
* Urgent Recommendation: Consider cutting SKUs, rebranding, or reviewing supplier costs.

##### Seafood
* Low Revenue: £29,639
* Avg. Price: £21 (below average)
* Low Units Sold: 1,445
* Insight: Underperforming across all metrics.
* Recommendation: Audit customer demand or supplier issues — perhaps it's too niche or poorly marketed.

##### Produce
* Very Low Units Sold: 715
* Avg. Price: £32
* Revenue: £23,439
* Insight: Small product count and low volume, though pricing isn't terrible.
* Opportunity: Market more heavily or consider whether it’s too seasonal to scale.
